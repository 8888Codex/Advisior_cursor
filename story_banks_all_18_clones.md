**Sponsors**: Mars, Unilever, P&G, Coca-Cola, Danone, Red Bull, LinkedIn

**Core Research Findings**:
- Brands grow by acquiring new & light buyers (not loyalty)
- Double Jeopardy Law: Smaller brands have fewer buyers AND lower loyalty
- Loyalty programs don't drive growth (minimal impact)

**Métricas**:
- Mental Market Share (% of total CEP associations)

**Practical Rules**:
